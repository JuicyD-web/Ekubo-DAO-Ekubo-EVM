# Revenue Sharing System Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the revenue sharing system for the Ekubo Protocol EVM implementation. The system ensures that all protocol-derived revenue is distributed according to the Ekubo DAO Shared Revenue License 1.0.

## How Revenue Sharing Works

- **Revenue Sources:**  
  All fees, profits, and income generated by the protocol (e.g., swaps, liquidity provision, transaction fees).

- **Distribution:**  
  A fixed percentage of total protocol revenue is allocated to Ekubo DAO as specified in the license.

- **Calculation:**  
  Revenue is calculated quarterly based on on-chain and/or off-chain data, net of direct transaction costs.

- **Payment:**  
  Operators must transfer the revenue share to the designated Ekubo DAO address at the end of each reporting period.

- **Reporting:**  
  Detailed revenue reports must be submitted to Ekubo DAO, including calculation methodology and supporting data.

## Compliance

All operators and contributors must comply with the revenue sharing obligations outlined in the Ekubo DAO Shared Revenue License 1.0. Non-compliance may result in loss of rights to use or distribute the protocol.
